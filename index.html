    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach 
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take 
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes 
        everything from command line and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, 
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. 
        We believe there are <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong> who 
        can benefit from learing technical sophistication, probably more. To 
        join our movement, sign up for our offical email list now.

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee 
        Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
        sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit 
        at least a billion people, and probably more.
