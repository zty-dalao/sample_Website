    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach 
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take 
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes 
        everything from command line and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, 
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. 
        We believe there are <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong> who 
        can benefit from learing technical sophistication, probably more. To 
        join our movement,  <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the
        <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorials</a> and the 
        <a href="https://www.softcover.io">Softcover publishing platform</a>. 
        This page is part of the sample site for 
        <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to 
        Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basic of

    <h2>Founders</h2>

    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee 
        Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
        sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit 
        at least a billion people, and probably more.

    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

    <p>
        Michael is the creater of the <a href="https://wwww.railstutorial.org">
        Ruby on Rails Tutorials</a> and principal author of the 
        <a href="https://www.learnenough.com">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> 
        introductory squeence. He is an advanced student of 
        <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step 
        plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain 
        are slightly exaggerated.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

    <p>
        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes 
        on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing 
        interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the 
        interface-realted Learn Enough tutorials.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

    <p>
        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy 
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd 
        at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a 
        tour bus s he is from his kitchen table.
